| Criteria                | GitHub Copilot                              | Traditional Coding Methods           |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Speed**               | Faster code generation with AI suggestions  | Manual, slower, depends on user      |
| **Learning Curve**      | Easy for beginners, less syntax memorization| Requires strong language knowledge   |
| **Error Reduction**     | Reduces typos and boilerplate mistakes      | Prone to human error                 |
| **Code Quality**        | Suggests best practices, but may need review| Depends on developer's experience    |
| **Creativity**          | Offers multiple solutions, inspires users   | Relies on developer's own knowledge  |
| **Documentation**       | Can generate comments and docs automatically| Manual documentation                 |
| **Refactoring**         | Suggests refactoring and improvements       | Manual refactoring                   |
| **Collaboration**       | AI assists individually, not team-based     | Team reviews, pair programming       |
| **Dependency Awareness**| Suggests libraries, but may miss context    | Developer chooses dependencies       |
| **Customization**       | Adapts to user style over time              | Fully customizable by user           |
| **Offline Capability**  | Requires internet for best results          | Fully offline                        |
| **Cost**                | Subscription required                       | Free (except for IDE/tools)           |

**Summary:**
- GitHub Copilot accelerates development, reduces repetitive work, and helps beginners.
- Traditional methods offer full control, deeper understanding, and are not dependent on AI or internet.
